================

•	The project was a part of Machine Learning Programming Assignment on Coursera. •	The main aim was to classify hand-written digits using supervised learning on a data corpus of 4000 samples each consisting of 400 pixels image of hand-written digits.  •	Applied Supervised Logistic Regression algorithm in order to classify the digits. •	The prediction accuracy was found to be 96%. •	The algorithm was implemented in Octave.
